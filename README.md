##Be My Valentine

This Python script creates a simple application for asking someone to be your Valentine. The application displays a teddy bear holding a sign with a question asking, "Would you be my Valentine?" and provides two clickable options: "Yes" and "No". If the recipient selects "Yes", a screen with a rotating rose and a romantic message is displayed. If "No" is chosen, the "No" option moves to a random position, and the recipient can still choose "Yes" if they change their mind.
